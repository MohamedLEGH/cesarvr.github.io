#### About Me

Iâ€™m a Full Stack Software Developer always looking and struggling to build the perfect software, where perfect means, the ability of software to be resilient to one of the major forces change. One of my favorite area of work are computer graphics and distributed computing, focusing in microservices.

I also love wisdom ( philosophia ) like to read books about the great thinkers like Sartre, Descartes, Cornel West, etc. I got introduce to those provocative ideas thanks to my favourite film of all time the documentary The Matrix. 

Here are some of my open source projects I work on:

- [PDF-Generator](https://github.com/cesarvr/pdf-generator)
    A Apache Cordova plugin to create PDF using phone internal API develop compatible with iOS/Android.

- [Ella](https://github.com/cesarvr/Ella)
    Is a native NodeJS add-on to comunicate your Javascript with Java, basically allows to use Java API in NodeJS.

- [probe-mon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/probe-mon)
    An ugly named, but easy to use plugin is a ExpressJS middleware that helps time your endpoints.

Here I was learning the basics, OpenGL initialization, pushing triangles and writting simple shaders.

As I become more skilled I wrote this simple graphic engine with simple wavefront parser, skybox, camera manipulation and simple light simulation.
