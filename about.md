#### About Me
My name is **CÃ©sar**, Architect/Software Engineer at Red Hat and this is my place to write about my one of my favorite things to do design and write software. 

Here are some of my Open Source projects.

- [PDF-Generator](https://github.com/cesarvr/pdf-generator)
##### A Apache Cordova plugin to create PDF using phone internal API develop compatible with iOS/Android.

- [Ella](https://github.com/cesarvr/Ella)
##### Is a native NodeJS add-on to comunicate your Javascript with Java, basically allows to use Java API in NodeJS.

- [probe-mon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/probe-mon)
##### An ugly named, but easy to use plugin is a ExpressJS middleware that helps time your endpoints.

### Other Works

Also I'm a fan of computer graphics, here are some stuff I write in my free time.

#### WebGL 

This is some of my pet projects with WebGL, experimenting with fractals, geometry deformation and other stuff.

Here I was learning the basics, OpenGL initialization, pushing triangles and writting simple shaders.

As I become more skilled I wrote this simple graphic engine with simple wavefront parser, skybox, camera manipulation and simple light simulation.
