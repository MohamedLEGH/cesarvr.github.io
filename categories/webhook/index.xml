      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some days ago, I was watching this video about Istio in Google I/O and while watching it, I started to think on how to do it or how they achieve this or that feature. So, as an excuse to learn how to build containers that collaborate with each other, I decided to replicate some of the functionalities I saw in that video for fun and at the same time to learn how I can encapsulate behaviour like I usually do with objects, but with containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
