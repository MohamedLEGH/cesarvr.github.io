This is my first attempt to develop a WebGL library just to learn the API and to continue my self-teaching Geometry, to be able to do more advance demos. 

Here i try to create a Koch fractal using my homemade WebGL API. My approach is to try to recursively calculate all the position and save it in object space, so i only use one array, then send it to the GPU, and get it printed in the screen.  

the fractal is here: [koch]
