title: "How to generate a PDF using Cordova, Android and IOS"
---

Some of my work is to desing and develop end-to-end mobile/desktop application for the two gigant ecosystem using Apache Cordova and using Node.JS, One of the challenges I have faced is to create PDF, the usual way to solve was to try to create it in the cloud and send it to the phone, this is not nice, one of the obvious reason is you need network connectivity for this to work, so I decide to move this task to the mobile device that to be honest are very powerful this days, so I wrote this cordova-pdf-generator for this.
