This is me trying to do some kind of morphing, for now my approach is to modify the entire Array (5500+) entries, with new interpolated position between (a, b).

The effect look satisfying, but i think it can been done a little better, but well not bad for a first attempt. 


this is the same Koch but with some "morphing": [koch]
