#Vim shorcuts.

Here some shortcuts for my favorite IDE [ Vim ].

#Searching files 

cause i dont have to much patiente navigating with arrow cursors in NerdTree.


put your cursor in a word and press <br>gf</br> open file, very handy if you want to go inside a dependency like require('module').  


>search and open the file. 

<pre>
<code class="javascript">
  tabfind filename
</code>
</pre>
